# Unit Tests

These are the Unit tests developed to test my python scripts.

## Documentation

Check my oficial [***documentation***](https://joaohb07.github.io/documentation/python/unit_tests) for more information on my python projects!

## Usage

1. Clone `main` branch from [***python-projects***](https://github.com/joaohb07/python-projects).

2. Access the tests folder to install the requirements

    ```bash title="Access tests folder"
    cd python-projects/tests/
    ```

3. Run pip install to install the requirements, I recommend you use an virtual environment:

    - Create and activate a new python virtual environment.

        ```bash
        python3 -m venv <venv_name>
        source <venv_name>/bin/activate
        ```

    - Use the package manager ***[pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)*** to install requirements.

        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

4. Run Unit tests:

    ```bash title="Run Unit Tests"
    pytest
    ```
