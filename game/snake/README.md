# Snake game

For developing this simple snake game I used ***[pygame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/)*** library.

## Documentation

Check my oficial [***documentation***](https://joaohb07.github.io/documentation/python/snake_game/snake/) for more information on my python projects!

## Installation

This script is developed in ***[python3.7 >](https://www.python.org/downloads/)***, make sure you have this installed before run it.

- Clone `main` branch from my ***[python-projects repo](https://github.com/joaohb07/python-projects)***.

- Create and activate a new python virtual environment.

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv <venv_name>
    source <venv_name>/bin/activate
    ```

- Use the package manager ***[pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)*** to install requirements.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

How to run snake game after activating the virtual environment:

```bash
cd python-projects/game/snake
python3 snake.py
```
